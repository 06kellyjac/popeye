# Popeye - A Kubernetes linter and scanner


Popeye is a utility that lints a K8s cluster and reports potential issues with
various Kubernetes resources. It cruises thru deployed resources for potential misconfigurations and scans a cluster to ensure best practices are in place thus
preventing potential future headaches. It aim at reducing the cognitive *over*load
that one faces when managing and operating a Kubernetes cluster in the wild.

When it comes to Kubernetes cluster management, Popeye is all about `Biffing'em and Buffing'em!`
