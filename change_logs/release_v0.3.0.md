## Change Logs

### New Sanitizers

Added Sanitize reports for the following resources:

+ HorizontalPodAutoscaler
+ PersistentVolume
+ PersistentVolumeClaim
+ StatefulSet
+ Deployment

Popeye will now scan for configuration and usage issues that may arise from these resources.
In addition, Popeye now includes resource utilization tracker codename: `Capacitor` to track over/under resource allocations for cpu and memory. Furthermore the **Capacitor** warns you
when you've maxed out your cluster capacity should say HPA's start firing. This assumes your
pods declarations include resource requests/limits.

### Report Formats

Added support for YAML and JSON output via `-o` CLI parameter.

NOTE: The jurassic mode tho still available has been moved to `-o jurassic`
